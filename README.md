      # MULTI-AI-AGENT
      
      üß† MultiAI Agent System
      Overview
      
      MultiAI Agent is a multi-agent system built using LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq LLMs, designed to collaborate on complex tasks.
      The system simulates a team of AI agents (Supervisor, Researcher, Analyst, Writer) working together to gather information, analyze it, and produce a professional report.
      
      This project demonstrates advanced AI agent orchestration and showcases how LLMs can cooperate in multi-step reasoning and workflow automation.
      
      Libraries
      
      LangChain: For building LLM-powered pipelines.
      
      LangGraph: For state-driven agent orchestration.
      
      Groq LLM API: Provides fast inference with LLaMA-3.1.
      
      Python-dotenv: For managing environment variables.
      
      Standard Libraries: os, datetime, typing.
      
      Project Logic Highlights
      
      Supervisor Agent: Decides workflow and delegates tasks.
      
      Researcher Agent: Gathers background information, statistics, and examples.
      
      Analyst Agent: Analyzes findings and extracts insights.
      
      Writer Agent: Produces a structured, professional final report.
