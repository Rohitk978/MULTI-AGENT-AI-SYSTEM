MultiAI Agent System
Overview
The MultiAI Agent System is a collaborative multi-agent framework powered by LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq LLMs. It orchestrates a team of AI agents‚ÄîSupervisor, Researcher, Analyst, and Writer‚Äîto handle complex tasks like information gathering, analysis, and professional report generation. Leveraging Groq's LLaMA-3.1 model, this project showcases advanced AI agent orchestration, multi-step reasoning, and seamless workflow automation.
Libraries

LangChain: For building LLM-powered pipelines.
LangGraph: For state-driven agent orchestration.
LangChain-Groq: For integrating Groq's LLaMA-3.1 model.
Python-dotenv: For managing environment variables.
Standard Libraries: Including os, datetime, and typing for core functionality.

Project Logic Highlights

Task Orchestration: Supervisor agent assigns tasks to appropriate agents.
Data Collection: Researcher gathers facts, statistics, and case studies.
Insight Extraction: Analyst processes data to identify risks, opportunities, and recommendations.
Report Generation: Writer compiles structured, professional reports.
Workflow Management: Router function ensures smooth agent transitions until task completion.

Key Features

Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents work together to produce high-quality outputs.
Automated Research: Collects data using Groq-powered LLMs.
Smart Analysis: Extracts actionable insights, risks, and recommendations.
Professional Reports: Generates polished, executive-style reports.
Groq Integration: Utilizes LLaMA-3.1 for fast and efficient reasoning.
Stateful Workflow: Memory-based routing for seamless task coordination.
